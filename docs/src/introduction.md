# Time-Domain Analysis

The time-domain analysis contains the following analysis methods:

- Mean: This is the mean value of the RR intervals. It is calculated by summing all NN intervals and then dividing by their number. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Arithmetic_mean_(AM))

- SDNN: This is the standard deviation of the NN intervals. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability#Time-domain_methods[36])

- RMSSD: This is the root mean square of the differences between successive NN intervals. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability#Time-domain_methods[36])

- SDSD: This is the standard deviation of the differences between successive NN intervals. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability#Time-domain_methods[36])

- NN20/NN50: This is the number of pairs of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 20ms/50ms. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability#Time-domain_methods[36])

- pNN20/pNN50: This is the percentage of pairs of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 20ms/50ms. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability#Time-domain_methods[36])

- rRR: The relative RR intervals are calculated using the equation
  for i=2...n
  ``rr\underset{i}:=\frac{2*(RR\underset{i}-RR\underset{i-1})}{RR\underset{i}-RR\underset{i-1}}
